# CHBA-Java-Mission
One-month Java application development mission


This project, carried out for the Bois de l'Abbaye Hospital, aimed to replace the existing software used to print various operation schedules. This new software takes into account several parameters, such as the date range, doctors identified by their code, and the three possible requests: the Oneday operation list, the list of care units, and basic patient information.
